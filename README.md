# Insurance Prediction App

This project is an Insurance Prediction App built using **Flask**, **Python**, and **Docker**. It leverages multiple regression models 
(Lasso, OLS, ElasticNet, Ridge) to predict insurance charges based on user-provided input. The app provides a **REST API** for predictions 
and includes an interactive **HTML interface** where users can enter variables to receive predictions.
